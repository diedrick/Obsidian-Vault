Give me context

Don't show me things that are crooked

Pass the ball and talk to your coworkers:

Don't add new abstractions without a discussion:
Example: purposes, twig extensions


Don't create new non-company code standards unless agreed upon, like caps for vars that aren't const:

Avoid code fragmentation, like a random < script > in the middle of something


Don't create errors upstream because of a lack of imagination or a lack of testing, like the new FIELD_TREATMENTS that broke all wysiwygs without an uploader.
