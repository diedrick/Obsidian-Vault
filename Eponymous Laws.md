Gall's law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."

Schneier's law: "Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it."
